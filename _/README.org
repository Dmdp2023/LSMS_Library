Some things you can do:
* Build files
This will build all the files associated with Uganda:
#+begin_src sh
make build country=$(COUNTRY)   # E.g., make build country=Uganda
#+end_src
* Test files
This will test the structure and correctness of files that have been built.
#+begin_src sh
make test country=$(COUNTRY)   # E.g., make test country=Uganda
#+end_src
