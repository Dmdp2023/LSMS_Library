* Introduction
These notes document a process for mapping data on food consumption
and expenditures in the Ugandan LSMS into nutritional outcomes which
allow comparison with standard recommended dietary intakes.

To make this all work, it's important that units and labels match
across different datasets.

The different datasets should be indexed as follows:

   | Dataset            | Indexed by | Columns |
   |--------------------+------------+---------|
   | Expenditures       | j,t,m      | i       |
   | Consumption        | j,t,m,u    | i       |
   | HH Characteristics | j,t,m      | k       |
   | FCT                | i,u        | n       |
   | RDI                | n          | k       |
   | Prices             | t,m        | i       |

where =j= indexes households, =t= indexes periods, =m= indexes
markets, =i= indexes goods, =k= indexes different kinds of household
characteristics, =u= indexes different unit names, and =n= indexes
different nutrients.  Any RDI ("recommended daily intake") tables
should be indexed by nutrients, with columns corresponding to
characteristics of persons within the household (e.g., age & sex
categories).  Finally, for any given good prices are assumed to be the
same within a period and market.

After getting all the indices to match, code below will write the
various datasets to different google sheets at

* RDI

   A compilation of dietary guidelines are provided at
   https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf;
   these provide recommended levels of 31 different nutrients by age
   and sex.  Here are selected nutrients from those guidelines.  With
   these selections and tweaked labels this should be regarded as the
   canonical input to project.

** Age-Sex category mapping
We need mappings of the nutrient labels from the FCT into the
nutrients in the RDA:

import pandas as pd

k_index = pd.Series([l[0] for l in k_index])
print(k_index.to_markdown())

* Expenditures
  The list of foods in the FCT is much more detailed and extensive
  than the list of foods we obtain from the expenditure surveys.
  What follows is a crude mapping of expenditure survey names into a
  set of preferred labels and =fct_codes=.

The following just modifies the output of =item_expenditures= to add a
"Preferred label" column (and column headings), and an "Aggregate
Label."  The "Aggregate Label" need not be unique; expenditures
for all items with the same "Aggregate Label" will be summed together.

also make the units match up with units (Kg) we expect for expenditure
quantities.

*** Harmonize labels, write Expenditures to google sheet
Here we munge expenditure labels to be harmonious with the FCT and
write to a google sheet.

#+RESULTS:

* Consumption
** Consumption units mapping
   The =i= labels for quantities consumed are the same as the =i=
   labels for expenditures, but we have a new set of unit labels =u=.

    There are different codes for different units in different rounds
    of the Uganda data; further the corresponding labels are sometimes
    irregular.

* Prices
From actual quantities converted (where possible) and corresponding
expenditures, we have unit values.  Since (almost by definition) we
imagine people in the same market facing the same prices, we take
prices to be equal to median unit values within a period-market.
** Harmonize labels, write prices to google sheet
Here we munge labels for unit values, find medians, and write to a google sheet.
