The Ghana Social Panel Survey (GhanaSPS) is one of two major surveys we have for Ghana, the other being the Ghana Living Standards Survey (Ghana LSS).
We have tried to make it possible to compare food expenditures not only across rounds within one of these surveys, but also across surveys.  The main tool needed for harmonization is a set of consistent food labels.  Those consistent labels are the "Aggregate Labels" found in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qZhbq5gpAmCsYH1ixUn0Ix_Cb5YKSIpU-Pc2_hh2lhU/.

Contains code common to different GSPS rounds.
** TODO food_items.org
See discussion above for harmonization of food labels across rounds and surveys.  But we should provide code here to usefully extract that information.
